# ReadMe Generator

## Description
As a developer I want a way to quickly and efficiently use command prompts via node.js to create a Read Me file.  I've created this Read Me Generator to do just that.

## Installation Instructions
In order to install my project you will need to have node.js installed as well as install the inquirer package from www.npmjs.com - once you have these two items you can use the node index.js prompt to launch the command line and it will begin asking questions.  Simply answer the questions and it will populate a readme for you.

## Usage
After writing a new program/ App having a thorough read me is crucial for end users.  This project will help speed up that process.
